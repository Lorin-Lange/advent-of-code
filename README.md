## Why *Haskell*?
The progamming language *Haskell* is very well suited for mathematical notions, pure computations and and has a terse syntax. It's often marketed as 
"an advanced, purely functional programming language", that is declarative and statically typed.

 - [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

Sometimes, however, one needs stateful computations
with e. g. arrays that are better expressed in an imperative language like C++.

## Why *C++*?
I use C++ first and foremost because I'm too lazy to use C which would require me to implement a lot of data structures and algorithms myself. 

Since I'm at least as lazy as Haskell, I use therefore sometimes C++, too.

If not necessary, I don't write object oriented code.
